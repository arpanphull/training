## Training Data Value

The system successfully generates training data with:
- **Exact bounding boxes** for career/job navigation elements
- **Scroll positions** where elements are found
- **Navigation paths** from homepage to job listings
- **Page URLs** at each step

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Handle redirects better** - Follow redirects and continue searching
2. **Check multiple navigation paths** - Explore "About" sections
3. **Improve click reliability** - Use multiple click methods
4. **Handle separate career domains** - Maintain list of known career sites
5. **Increase scroll coverage** - Ensure complete page coverage

## Example Training Data Structure

```json
{
  "label": "Careers",
  "bbox": [150, 510, 201, 523],
  "page_url": "https://www.amazon.com/",
  "scroll_position": 4000,
  "viewport_number": 5,
  "timestamp": "2025-08-05T17:50:59.424255"
}
```

This data can be used to train models to:
- Predict where career links are located (typically footer)
- Identify career-related text patterns
- Navigate multi-step paths to job listings
- Handle various website structures
